# Introduction to Babel

The purpose of this write-up is to help new and future contributors to the project, primarily students, familiarize themselves with the purpose and usage of Babel. We also describe Babel's design, particularly how it performs its error analysis.

This document assumes only surface-level knowledge of Clojure. We expect that the reader at least possesses a level of understanding about Clojure equivalent to playing around with the language for a couple of weeks or so. We do our best to explain the necessary mechanical details about the language here.

Surface-level knowledge about Clojure's REPL works is beneficial. Practice with using the `spec` library and manipulating Clojure error data is even more useful. Links to resources and documentation are provided at the end of this document.
