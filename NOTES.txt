One example of labeling that we do absolutely need:

Just a string of the error message; i.e., just the text.

We should start by first converting everything to a vector of a single map,
which just contains the output text for the middleware. Then, start breaking it
apart.

We need to make it work with the REPL first, which means that we need to guarantee that
we get the original error message output as a string for the middleware to print out.

We are starting by just catching all places where this process needs to occur.
This needs to essentially be testable, i.e., the high-level functions don't really know
that we changed much.

(We are using vectors of pairs now rather than maps.)

---

Two tasks that make a good starting point:

1. Make a superficial vector that works with all of the string info we already have.
(The debugging is going to be really scary)

2. Think of what that vector is actually (for real) going to look like.
(John should also look into this because he is ultimately the one implementing it)


Some of the stuff we will be labeling includes:

** :type
- Definitely types (are we distinguishing between kinds of types? general, specific, etc.)
    - expected/actual types

** :txt
- Definitely plaintext
    - pay attention to "terms" within plaintext, such as `type`, `constructor`, `if`,
      (i.e. you cannot use the same **key** in a **hashmap** twice)

** :val
- Definitely values/instances (as opposed to types)
    - primarily values in spec (number, string, etc.)
      (e.g. "Expected a map but got a number **5** instead")
    - keywords [? to be clarified]

<the various names>

** :coll
- Collection names (such as:)
    - maps
    - vectors ?
    - lists ?

** :fn
- Function names (*)

** :class
- Class names, may possibly be different from other names (*)
    - NOT exception classes.

** :symbol
- Symbols, which may just be names

** :file
- Resource/file names

** :ex-class
- Native Clojure/Java exception messages
    - names of their classes, such as NullPointerException

</the various names>

** :literal
- literals (all fall under LispReaderExceptions)
    - also arg literals (IllegalStateExceptions)

** :arity
- numbers (as a part of syntax requirements, i.e. arity)
    - (does not include numbers spelled out in English, these are part of text)
    - (see length-ref in processor, mainly spec related)

** :delimiter
- Delimiters, mainly unmatched ones

** :code
- Expressions (which are code; more common in spec)
    - please do not try to break down expressions, we don't need to

** :pred
- Predicates, Assert condition(?)
